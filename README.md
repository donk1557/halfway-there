# halfway-there
This application was created to make it easier to hang out with friends! After inputting two locations and an activity, you will be given infomation on activities(based on your input) within the midpoint of the two given locations. 

This application works by generating a route between two locations, we are able to find the coordinates of the midpoint along that route. We then pass those coordinates to call nearby activities that match the users preferences.

This program searches Movie_Glu API to give addresses of cinemas near the midpoint as well as current showtimes and the four most popular movies playing at the time.

This program uses Google maps api in order to determine the two locatons and the midpoint between them. While also using google maps places within the google maps api in order to grab location of activities.
